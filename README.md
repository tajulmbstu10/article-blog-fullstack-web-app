## Fullstack Web Application [Article Blog]

##Backend Setup

This is the backend part of fullstack application like a Article Blog. Where user can add any article. User can also update or delete his article. All of this article are stored in the backend. It is developed by using python django rest framework. This is also a python djangorest api.  Here in backend there are no any security used for backend. The front end of this fullstack application was design and developed by using react.

Note: You must be installed python in your pc. If python is not installed then download python and install python in your pc. Then follow the instruction.

##How to setup backend-

At first clone it or download it. Now open powershell/commandline where you clone it. Then
## 	`cd backend` 
Install virtual env using 
##	`py -m virtualenv env` 
Activate virtual env 
##	`cd env`
##	`Scripts/activate` 
##	`cd ..`

After activate the virtual environment, go to backend directory that means 
## `cd backend`
##	`pip install -r requirements.txt`
##	`cd src`
##	`python manage.py runserver`

Your backend is ready... 
##  `localhost:8000`  
or
##	`localhost:8000/api`



## Front-end Setup

This is the front end of Article Blog fullstack application which is design and developed react js. It is a react application.

Note: You must be installed Node js. If Node js is not installed in your pc Please 
Download Node js and installed it first. Then follow the instruction.

##How to install 
Open powershell/cmd and Go to frontend folder

##	`npm install --save`
##	`npm start`
your front end is ready ----- in localhost:3000


Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
